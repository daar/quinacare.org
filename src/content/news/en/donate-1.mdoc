We would like to thank you personally for your donation. If this is something you would appreciate, please leave your email address in the payment details of your bank transfer.

Quina Care Foundation is a ‘Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling’ (ANBI - Public Benefit Organisation). This means that under certain circumstances, following the Dutch tax-law, donations are tax-deductible:

##### Donation

A donation can be deducted from your taxable income if it falls within 1% and 10% of your threshold income.

##### Periodical donation

You could also sponsor us for a longer period of time, which provides more certainty for us to continue the work of Quina Care. If you are willing to sponsor us for a 5-year period, your donation will be tax deductible in its entirety. To make use of this scheme all you need is a contract between yourself and Quina Care, which is possible without the involvement of a solicitor. You can download the necessary form [here](https://quinacare.org/document/Overeenkomst.pdf). Once completed, you can send it to us after which it will be signed by us and sent back to you. You can send the form to the following e-mailadress: treasurer@quinacare.org

If you have any questions or if you would like further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.
